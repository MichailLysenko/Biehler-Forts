        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>We look forward to seeing each other soon at Fortress Cologne in Germany from April 8 to 13, 2025.</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Biehler Forts, where we are dedicated to preserving and promoting the historical significance of fortresses through collaboration, research, and education.</p>

        <p>Our task is to organise the events dedicated to the history and architectural issues of the 19th century forts, built to the design of General Alexis von Biehler.</p>

        <p>Our project also pays attention to earlier and later building eras, as they influenced the appearance of the outer rings of Biehler's forts or the improvement of already
            existing structures after 1870. These self-sufficient fortifications from the last quarter of the 19th century still have important historical and architectural
            significance for modern fortress research.</p>

        <p>Our conferences have already resulted, among other things, in the establishment of cross-border cooperation and an international fortress fraternity. So far, the conferences
            have been attended by more than 100 participants, who stay in touch with each other, are keen to offer advice, share experience, materials and undertake new joint initiatives.</p>

        <p>The conference consists of two parts - practical and theoretical.</p>

        <p>During the practical part, participants visit sites, including those that are inaccessible on a daily basis.
            This provides a basis for comparative studies of the architectural details of the forts, their use and history. Such studies result, for example, in solutions to restoration
            problems. Particularly important for all participants in the project is also the search for possibilities of contemporary use of fort works, once designed for strictly military
            purposes and very often difficult to maintain.</p>

        <p>During the theoretical part, experts in the field of defence architecture will deliver papers on the history, architecture and uses of ancient military buildings.</p>
